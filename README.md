# About

Using this module, you can create dynamic projectiles for your 2 dimensional GUI-Based Roblox games! No matter what the rotation of the weapon is, you are able to shoot projectiles in the direction the weapon is facing to! This module is really helpful for people trying to make 2 Dimensional games on Roblox!

# How does it work?

Whenever a user interacts with their device (Custom Interactions can be scripted), a thin frame (ray) is created in the front face of a given Gui Object according to its rotation and relative to the Gui Object's size. A Projectile (bullet) is then created inside of that ray (relative to the ray's size) and is then tweened along the path of the ray, which you observe as moving projectiles on you screen!
